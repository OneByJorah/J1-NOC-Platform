"""osTicket helpdesk collector.

Queries OSTICKET_BASE_URL with OSTICKET_API_KEY from the vault and writes the
ticket list to /srv/jnop/data/helpdesk_tickets.json. That file is what the
dashboard overview reads for its open_tickets KPI, so this collector makes the
ticket count live. Credentials are passed only as the X-API-Key header and are
never written to disk or logs.
